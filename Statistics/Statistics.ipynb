In the context of multiple random variables, a marginal distribution focuses on one variable while ignoring the others. Here are some key points about marginal distributions:\n",

    "For discrete random variables X and Y, the marginal PMF for X is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Individual Probability Distribution:** A marginal distribution represents the probability distribution of a single random variable while keeping the others fixed or marginalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Marginal Probability Function (PMF) for Discrete Variables:** For discrete random variables X and Y, the marginal PMF for X is calculated by summing the joint PMF over all possible values of Y. Mathematically:\n",
